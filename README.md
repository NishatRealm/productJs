## JavaScript Questions & Answers

**1) What is the difference between null and undefined?**
- **undefined:** Means a variable has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it yet.
- **null:** Intentionally keeps a value empty but can assign manually later

**2) What is the use of the map() function? How is it different from forEach()?**
- **map():** It goes through an array and returns a new with modified data.
- **forEach():** loops or executes once for each elements but returns nothing

**3) What is the difference between == and ===?**
- **== (Loose):** Checks only the value (e.g., `5 == "5"` is true).
- **=== (Strict):** Checks both the value and the data type (e.g., `5 === "5"` is false).

**4) What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?**
- It makes asynchronous code easier to read and write. It allows the program to wait for the API response before moving to the next line, preventing errors.

**5) Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).**
- **Global:** Variables accessible from anywhere in the script.
- **Function:** Variables accessible only inside the function they are in.
- **Block:** Variables (like `let` or `const`) accessible only inside a specific `{}` block (like an `if` or `for` loop).
